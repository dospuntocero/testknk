You cannot cut materials thicker than 3 mm.  Also, with the blade, you cannot cut hard acrylic, steel, glass, and other dense materials.  With some materials, such as craft plastic and styrene, you can cut thin sheets (0.02” or 0.5 mm) but not thicker sheets. A general rule of thumb is that if you can cut it with a craft knife by hand, you can mostly likely cut it with the Force blade holder.\r\n\r\n* If you purchased the optional KNK Force rotary tool, you have more options for cutting.  For example, 1/8” (3 mm) hard acrylic can be cut. You can also perform deeper engraving than if using the optional Force engraver which can only achieve thin line “scratch” engraving.\r\n\r\n* The KNK Force has two tool seats on the head. This means you can perform functions such as score and cut, emboss and cut, draw and emboss, etc by having different tools inserted into the left and right sides of the machine’s head.\r\n\r\n* The KNK Force has a camera which facilitates calibrating the relative positions of two tools. It also is used in print and cut applications, whereby you send a design to your own printer. The image is printed, along with registrations marks. The camera then locates the registration marks on the printout and cuts out the shapes accordingly.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT!**  The KNK Force is unlike any other blade-based cutter on the market! Regardless of your past experience with other cutters, including prior KNK models, it is VERY important that you understand the new principles behind cutting. Please take the time to read the following before trying out your new incredible machine!\r\n\r\n* The KNK Force has Z axis control. Instead of the head “dropping” to begin cutting, it will move downward at a controlled speed. This change was necessary for adding rotary tool capability.  It has also added a great deal of power, as well as functionality, to the cutter.\r\n\r\n* The blade will now be fully extended at all times. With new depth settings, you control how “far down” the blade will try to cut.  Blades are fragile however, so use caution when inserting and removing your blade holder from the Force, as well as storing your blade holder.  Also, avoid “seeing what happens” by using extreme settings!  You can easily break a blade doing that!\r\n\r\n* Every time you insert the blade holder, you will set a Z Axis origin with the blade tip resting on either the top of the material or the top of the cutting mat. Thus you will no longer need to estimate how high to insert the blade holder above the material. It’s important, when setting this origin, to not have the tool tightened within the blade holder seat until after the blade holder seat drops. The text on the screen will remind you because this is another way you can break a blade!\r\n\r\n* The blade holder has a Blade Tension setting. This setting is used to provide more or less force, depending on the material being cut.  A material such as vinyl or thin paper will require the least amount of tension, while a material like mat board will require the most.  More is covered in Section 1.08.\r\n\r\n* There is no longer a Force or Pressure setting. This is due to the fact that the force applied is a combination of the Cutting Depth / Ending Depth and the Blade Tension settings. This will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.\r\n\r\n* With multi-pass cutting, you now have the ability to cut progressively through a material versus the blade trying to penetrate the entire thickness on the first pass. You will enter a Starting Depth, an Ending Depth, and the number of Passes.\r\n\r\n* There are changes in how you approach cutting some materials compared to how they’ve been cut in the past. For example, there will be different settings for vinyl cut on a mat versus vinyl cut without the mat. These will be presented separately in the recommended settings table.\r\n\r\n* Use the included test pen until you know, with confidence, where shapes will cut.\r\n\r\n## Safety and Warnings\r\n\r\nPlease be aware of the following safety guidelines when working with the KNK Force:\r\n\r\n* **Pinch Points**:  Keep hands, long hair, loose clothing, jewelry, etc. away from the moving parts.\r\n\r\n* **Risk to Children and Pets**:  Please supervise children around the Force, when it is in use.  In particular, the rotary device can pose a danger to unsupervised children and pets.\r\n\r\n* **Eye Protection**:  When operating the rotary device, eye protection, such as safety glasses, is recommended.\r\n\r\n* **Rotary Tool Instructions**: Please read Sections 7.01 – 7.07 before using the optional rotary tool.\r\n\r\n* **Movement and Touching**:  Do not move the KNK Force or touch any circuitry while it is plugged in.\r\n\r\n###Additionally\r\n\r\n* **DO NOT** touch or jam the plotter’s track while it is operating. If the cutter is damaged, it is the owner’s responsibility.\r\n\r\n* **DO NOT** shake the cutter while it is operating.\r\n\r\n* **DO NOT** cut any materials that have staples or other embellishments attached.\r\n\r\n* **DO NOT** touch the cutter with a magnet. It is safe, however, to cut magnetic materials, such as those used on refrigerators and car exteriors.\r\n\r\n* **DO NOT** allow small items to fall into the cutter.\r\n\r\n* **Transporting** When transporting the cutter, move the pinch wheel levers into the upward position or remove them from the Force by sliding to the far right side (as you face the front of the cutter). Remove the blade from the blade holder and cover the tip with the plastic cap. Also, remove items from the storage compartments inside the fold-down table.\r\n\r\n## Warranty\r\n\r\n* If your KNK Force is damaged during shipment or appears to be defective, then your dealer should be notified as soon as possible. If damages are reported later than three weeks after delivery, then it will be the responsibility of the owner to ship the damaged cutter back to KNK USA for repair.\r\n\r\n\r\n* The one year parts and labor warranty covers manufacturer’s defects only and does not include normal wear and tear. If warranty work is required, the owner is responsible for shipping costs to and from KNK USA.\r\n\r\n* KNK Force owners outside the USA should contact their dealer for procedures regarding warranty work or shipping damage.\r\n\r\n* It is also recommended that you retain the original box with packing materials in case you ever need to ship your KNK Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\n* If you run into difficulties with the operation of your KNK Force, turn off the power and look for a solution in this manual. Appendix A is a list of Troubleshooting FAQ’s.  If you continue to have technical questions or issues, please contact your KNK dealer as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n* For any shipping issues, including delays or damages, please contact KNK USA (or your KNK distributor if you are outside the USA) as soon as possible so that appropriate action with the shipping company can be initiated.\r\n\r\n* For any mechanical issues, please contact KNK USA. \r\n\r\n* For more help in learning your Force, as well as sharing ideas and photos of projects with other owners, the following user groups are recommended: \r\n1.

You do not want to tear or break the Styrofoam end pieces, in case you need them at a future time.\r\n* Remove the Styrofoam end cap protectors from either side. Cut open and remove the plastic bag from around the Force.  Place the Force on a firm flat surface. \r\n* Open the front fold-down table and remove the large and small foam pieces tucked around the cutting head.\r\n* Because the cutting mat must be folded over to fit into the box, it may have become slighly rounded during shipping. Gently roll the mat in the opposite direction to remove the roundness and place on a flat table to make sure the mat now lies horizontally to the surface.  Refer to Section 1.10 for additional instructions on preparing the mat for use.\r\n* We recommend retaining the original box with the foam inserts in case you ever need to ship your KNK.\r\n* Verify that you have received all contents. There is a checklist in Section 1.06. Please notify your KNK supplier immediately if anything is missing.\r\n\r\n##Contents \r\n* Your KNK Force package comes with the following:\r\n* KNK Force digital die cutter\r\n* 15” x 15” cutting mat (refer to Section 1.09 for instructions)\r\n* Blade holder (refer to Section 1.08  for instructions)\r\n* Two blades: thin material blade (red cap) and thick material blade (blue cap)\r\n* Test pen\t\r\n* Three pinch wheel assemblies (refer to Section 1.10 for instructions)\t\r\n* Power cord and AC/DC adaptor\t\t\t\t\t\r\n* Ethernet Cable\t\r\n* USB – Wi-Fi adaptor and CD (Note: the enclosed CD does NOT require installation. It’s already been done and the adaptor is already plugged into the right side of the Force)\r\n\r\n##Parts of the Force\r\n![Parts of the machine](https://github.com/dospuntocero/testknk/blob/master/images/parts.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n##Blade holders and Blades\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of blades for the KNK Force: \r\n![Parts of the machine](https://github.com/dospuntocero/testknk/blob/master/images/blades.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n- The 45 degree red capped blade is suited for cutting thinner materials such as paper, all cardstock types, iron-on transfer, and vinyl. \r\n- The 60 degree blue capped blade is a much longer blade and is well-suited for cutting thicker materials, such as gum paste, craft plastic, craft foam, and rhinestone template material. \r\n- The 30 degree yellow capped blade is a wide blade and is well suited for cutting fabric and felt. \r\n\r\n* Note that the **red capped blade** and **blue capped blades** have a cut back on the opposing side of the blade (right side, in the prior photo). This reduces the blade offset value and allows for better detailed cutting of small shapes.  \r\n\r\n* There are three blade holders sold for the Force: a **red one**, a **blue one**, and a **yellow one**. These three blade holders are identical, other than the color.  Thus, any color of Force blade holder can house any of the three Force blade types. \r\n\r\n* Owners who change materials often find it convenient to have the blade holders assigned to blade types whose caps match the color of the holder itself. In other words, they will only use red capped blades in their red blade holder, blue capped blades in their blue blade holder and yellow capped blades in their yellow blade holder.  Again, this is a personal choice. Any of the three blade types can be used in any of the three Force blade holders.\r\n\r\n#Blade Installation\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uqrp7VCVfOk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n•\tThe blade must be carefully inserted into the blade holder.  Do this over a soft surface, such as a paper towel. It’s important to protect the fragile blade!  \r\n•\tUnscrew and set aside the blade holder cap at the bottom of the blade holder. Remove the protective plastic cap (e.g. the red cap) from a blade. Keep this plastic cap so that you can cover the blade again when you change to a different blade type.  \r\n•\tThe following photo shows how the blade will be installed relative to the blade holder cap and the main section of the blade holder\r\n\r\n![the blade holder](https://github.com/dospuntocero/testknk/blob/master/images/blade-holder.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n•\tInsert the blade into the main section of the blade holder, with the non-sharp end sitting inside a small hole in the center of the blade holder.\r\n\r\n![the blade](https://github.com/dospuntocero/testknk/blob/master/images/blade.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n•\tInside the blade holder cap is an insert with a hole. Carefully place the blade holder cap over the blade so that the blade tip slides into that hole:\r\n\r\n![the blade cap](https://github.com/dospuntocero/testknk/blob/master/images/blade-cap.png)\r\n\r\n•\tBegin tightening the cap. If there is any resistance, make sure the blade tip is being fed into the hole in the cap. Screw the cap back onto the holder until it is snug.\r\n\r\n![the cap tighten](https://github.com/dospuntocero/testknk/blob/master/images/blade-point.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n•\tBecause the blade is fully extended, it's very important to exercise caution when inserting and removing the holder from the Force. While the blade holders (with those blades extended) can easily be stored inside the fold-down table, you should remove the blade holders before transporting your cutter. Michele Harvey came up with a great idea for protecting the blade tips. She stores the holders in their original plastic tubes, but has added two foam pop dots in the bottom of the tube so that the blade will be resting against that foam:\r\n\r\n![the blade stored with a little piece of foam](https://github.com/dospuntocero/testknk/blob/master/images/blade-foam.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n•\tIf you don't have these foam pop dots, there are other alternatives, such as cutting a few small squares from craft foam or from an egg carton or even from a thick material such as felt.\r\n",
