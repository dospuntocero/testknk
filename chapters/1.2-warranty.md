### Warranty

* If your KNK Force is damaged during shipment or appears to be defective, then your dealer should be notified as soon as possible. If damages are reported later than three weeks after delivery, then it will be the responsibility of the owner to ship the damaged cutter back to KNK USA for repair.


* The one year parts and labor warranty covers manufacturerâ€™s defects only and does not include normal wear and tear. If warranty work is required, the owner is responsible for shipping costs to and from KNK USA.

* KNK Force owners outside the USA should contact their dealer for procedures regarding warranty work or shipping damage.

* It is also recommended that you retain the original box with packing materials in case you ever need to ship your KNK Force.
