### Safety and Warnings

Please be aware of the following safety guidelines when working with the KNK Force:

* Pinch Points:  Keep hands, long hair, loose clothing, jewelry, etc. away from the moving parts.

* Risk to Children and Pets:  Please supervise children around the Force, when it is in use.  In particular, the rotary device can pose a danger to unsupervised children and pets.

* Eye Protection:  When operating the rotary device, eye protection, such as safety glasses, is recommended.

* Rotary Tool Instructions: Please read Sections 7.01 – 7.07 before using the optional rotary tool.

* Movement and Touching:  Do not move the KNK Force or touch any circuitry while it is plugged in.

**Additionally**

* **DO NOT** touch or jam the plotter’s track while it is operating. If the cutter is damaged, it is the owner’s responsibility.

* **DO NOT** shake the cutter while it is operating.

* **DO NOT** cut any materials that have staples or other embellishments attached.

* **DO NOT** touch the cutter with a magnet. It is safe, however, to cut magnetic materials, such as those used on refrigerators and car exteriors.

* **DO NOT** allow small items to fall into the cutter.

* **Transporting** When transporting the cutter, move the pinch wheel levers into the upward position or remove them from the Force by sliding to the far right side (as you face the front of the cutter). Remove the blade from the blade holder and cover the tip with the plastic cap. Also, remove items from the storage compartments inside the fold-down table.
