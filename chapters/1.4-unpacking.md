•	After opening the box, slide the KNK Force out carefully. You do not want to tear or break the Styrofoam end pieces, in case you need them at a future time.
•	Remove the Styrofoam end cap protectors from either side. Cut open and remove the plastic bag from around the Force.  Place the Force on a firm flat surface. 
•	Open the front fold-down table and remove the large and small foam pieces tucked around the cutting head.
•	Because the cutting mat must be folded over to fit into the box, it may have become slighly rounded during shipping. Gently roll the mat in the opposite direction to remove the roundness and place on a flat table to make sure the mat now lies horizontally to the surface.  Refer to Section 1.10 for additional instructions on preparing the mat for use.
•	We recommend retaining the original box with the foam inserts in case you ever need to ship your KNK.
•	Verify that you have received all contents. There is a checklist in Section 1.06. Please notify your KNK supplier immediately if anything is missing.

###Blade holders and Blades

There are three kinds of blades for the KNK Force: 
![Parts of the machine](https://github.com/dospuntocero/testknk/blob/master/images/blades.png?raw=true)

- The 45 degree red capped blade is suited for cutting thinner materials such as paper, all cardstock types, iron-on transfer, and vinyl. 
- The 60 degree blue capped blade is a much longer blade and is well-suited for cutting thicker materials, such as gum paste, craft plastic, craft foam, and rhinestone template material. 
- The 30 degree yellow capped blade is a wide blade and is well suited for cutting fabric and felt. 

•	Note that the **red capped blade** and **blue capped blades** have a cut back on the opposing side of the blade (right side, in the prior photo). This reduces the blade offset value and allows for better detailed cutting of small shapes.  

•	There are three blade holders sold for the Force: a **red one**, a **blue one**, and a **yellow one**. These three blade holders are identical, other than the color.  Thus, any color of Force blade holder can house any of the three Force blade types. 

•	Owners who change materials often find it convenient to have the blade holders assigned to blade types whose caps match the color of the holder itself. In other words, they will only use red capped blades in their red blade holder, blue capped blades in their blue blade holder and yellow capped blades in their yellow blade holder.  Again, this is a personal choice. Any of the three blade types can be used in any of the three Force blade holders.
